You can see your godoc rendered as HTML by running a local godoc server.
This is great for previewing your godoc before committing changes. To do
that, Make sure your code is in GOPATH and run:
	godoc -http ":8080"
Go to http://localhost:8080/pkg and you should see your packages on the
list.

If you want the raw HTML, you can run:
	godoc -url=/pkg/your_package > your_page.html
